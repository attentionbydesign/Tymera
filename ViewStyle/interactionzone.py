For a given region (not the whole molecule), we might want to
    1. Hide Ribbons
    2. Show Atoms
    3. Distinguish backbone of a given region 
        from the rest of the molecule

This script will toggle such a view for any selected region,
instead of requiring each to be set individually

Potentially, might figure out an algo to determine regions of
proximity of atoms between different chains within a model and
automatically show the atoms of those regions.
