# # PRESET SETTINGS

# Set these things at the start of every session:

# * transparency 0.3, brightness 0.7
#     * or perhaps conditional upon color - i.e., for gray
#     * for other colors, T0.4, B1.0
# * voxel size setting???  mainly for SPIDER files
#     * issue is figuring out the original voxel size; is this even
#         present in the .DAT metadata?  and accessible by chimera?
# * sillhouttes off - conserve resources
# * step size setting (so you don't have to individually set)
# * no clipping!

# Essentially, this script should be automatically run at startup;

# the script itself should be a trigger to activate these settings
# whenever a new volume is opened...
