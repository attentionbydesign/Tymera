# # ###ID_Manager

# # # (Model ID) MID_manager: change ID #'s of models
# # # currently open in ModelPanel.

# #     - if a .brix file is detected, automatically assign
# # it #0.  If a different model currently occupies #0, switch places (i.e., avoid closing it)


# # (Chain ID) CID_manager: 
# #   -uses sequence identification to label
# the chains of a model, to help you identify which chains
# you want to change the ID of. 

#     - reorders the listed order of chains
# as reflected in the PDB file, so that a hierarchy
# is maintained
#         1. Sequence Similarity (i.e., Tn's, Tpm's, Actin)
#         2. Within sequence groups, go from top to bottom
# in the Y-axis position of the chain's centroid?
