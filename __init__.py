# this makes the whole tymera_1.0/ directory 
# recognizable as a plugin if you set the path 
# to the folder ONE LEVEL ABOVE it as that for 
# third-party plugins in the Chimera GUI


# i.e., the path to the folder you put all your 
# third-party plugins (e.g., iMODFIT) will be
# part of sys.path from startup instead of needing
# to append it for every session
